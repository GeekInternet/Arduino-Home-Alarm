This project aims to become an somewhat fully featured home alarm system
based on the Arduino (and compatible clones).

We will try to keep it simple and use the arduino UNO instead of the MEGA.

There is no release date, of course.
Door and window traps must be wired to the arduino (no wireless at the moment, sorry).
